    Broadcasts (announcements)
    ==========================

    The <broadcasts> tag contains a list of <schedule> tags, each of which broadcasts a
    randomly chosen message on a fixed time interval. Multiple schedules will run concurrently.

    A schedule can be limited to specific servers or game types:

        <schedule>
            <role>lobby/pgm</role>                      Lobby/PGM
            <network>public/tournament</network>        Tournament related vs everything else
            <realm>...</realm>                          Realm (see below)
            <game>arcade/mini/ranked</game>             Queue game ID
            <gamemode>ctw/blitz/etc...</gamemode>       PGM Gamemode - see https://docs.oc.tc/modules/main#gamemode
        </schedule>

    Realms are arbitrary tags defined by admins in the Data repo. A server can have many realms.
    Here are some examples of currently defined realms:

        public          Publicly listed servers
        practice        Tourament practice servers
        maptest         Map development servers (including residence and build)
        residence       Residence servers
        build           Builder server
        media           Media server - used by guest streamers
        party           Party server - used for special public events

    Under each <schedule> is a list of <messages> tags, each of which refers to a localized file
    containing a list of messages. The lists are effectively combined into one big list that the
    schedule chooses messages from. The path of message files is relative to the localized/broadcasts
    folder in this repo, which is automatically mirrored to /broadcasts on Crowdin.

    Each <messages> tag must also have a prefix="..." attribute with one of the following values:

        Prefix      Appearance      /toggle     Purpose
        ==============================================================================
        tip         [Tip]           Tips        Gameplay tips
        news        [News]          News        Current events, transient stuff
        alert       [Alert]         News        More important news
        info        [Info]          Facts       Informative, educational
        fact        [Fact]          Facts       Interesting things about the network
        chat        [Chat]          Random      Jokes, sayings, conversation starters

    The message file contains a single <resources> tag, which contains a <string> tag for each message.
    Each <string> must have a name="..." attribute with a unique identifier. Crowdin uses this name to
    keep track of the string when the file changes. The name must be unique within the file, but it does
    not have to be unique across files.

    A <string> tag can contain various inline formatting tags:

        <b>...</b>                          Bold
        <i>...</i>                          Italics
        <em>...</em>                        Emphasis (different color)
        <a href="...">...</a>               Link (leave tag empty to show the URL itself)
        <a type="home">...</a>              Link to our own website
        <a type="home" href="...">...</a>   Link to page on our website (e.g. href="/forums")
        <a type="user">...</a>              Link to viewer's profile
        <a type="user" href="...">...</a>   Link to path relative to profile (not current useful)

    These tags can also have any of the following attributes:

        bold="true/false"
        italic="true/false"
        underline="true/false"
        color="red/blue/light blue/etc"
